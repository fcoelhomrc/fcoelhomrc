I'm currently enrolled at a Master's degree in Engineering Physics. My main interest is optics & photonics, more specifically strategies to apply it to computation. 

# Past projects

- EESC TECH Chalange 2022 Hackathon (Local Round)
  - Our team developed machine learning solutions for automatic color palette generation based in image and text inputs, which was deployed as a website. We placed 2nd!

- INESC TEC Interships
  - Curricular Internship: Automatized a optical tweezer system, by developing an algorithm for particle detection & deploying it with a GUI
  - Summer Internship: Studied techniques for light modulation, employing it as an encoding method for optical computing, with applications to Machine Learning


- Microcontroller projects
  - Developed a PID controller for automatic balancing of a simplified drone model, using a ESP32 board and Micropython
  - Developed a prototype for a web application for assisting visually impaired people, using a color sensor to obtain text-to-speech color measurements
  
- Programmed a solver for Schr√∂dinger equation using finite difference methods, allowing for visualization of the classical double-slit experience
