I'm a Engineering Physics graduate at University of Porto, ready to begin my Master's degree focusing on Optics. I am also interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

# Current projects

Currently, I'm in an Internship with INESC TEC centered arround automation of optical tweezer systems. There, I've been developing an algorithm for automatizing the optical trapping procedure.

# Past projects

- EESC TECH Chalange 2022 Hackathon (Local Round)
  - Our team developed machine learning solutions for automatic color palette generation based in image and text inputs, which was deployed as a website. We achieved the 2nd place!
 
- Microcontroller projects
  - Developed a PID controller for automatic balancing of a simplified drone model, using a ESP32 board and Micropython
  - Developed a prototype for a web application for assisting visually impaired people, using a color sensor to obtain text-to-speech color measurements
  
- Programmed a solver for Schr√∂dinger equation using finite difference methods, allowing for visualization of the classical double-slit experience
