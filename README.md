I'm currently enrolled at a Master's degree in Engineering Physics, and a [research assistant](https://www.inesctec.pt/pt/pessoas/felipe-coelho-moreira#additional_information) at INESC-TEC's Center of Applied Photonics. My main interest is optics & photonics, more specifically I study strategies to apply these concepts to computation. 

# Past projects

- INESC TEC Interships
  - Curricular Internship: Automatized a optical tweezer system, by developing an algorithm for particle detection & deploying it with a GUI
  - Summer Internship: Studied techniques for light modulation, employing it as an encoding method for optical computing, with applications to Machine Learning

- Curricular projects
  - Developed a PID controller for automatic balancing of a simplified drone model, using a ESP32 board and Micropython
  - Developed a prototype for a web application for assisting visually impaired people, using a color sensor to obtain text-to-speech color measurements
  - Developed a solver for Schr√∂dinger equation using finite difference methods, allowing for simulation of 2D wavefunction propagation
  - Took on the [Intel Natural Image Classification Challange](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification), with clustering and semi-supervised approaches
  - Performed unsupervised anomaly detection with the [MVTec Dataset](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad), with several Deep Learning approaches including autoencoders, GANs, and Vision Transformers

- EESC TECH Chalange 2022 Hackathon (Local Round)
  - Our team developed machine learning solutions for automatic color palette generation based in image and text inputs, which was deployed as a website. We placed 2nd!
